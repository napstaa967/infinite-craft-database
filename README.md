# Infinite Craft Database
This is a small li'l repo I'm making to store all of the items I've found while spamming infinite craft
go play the game https://neal.fun/infinite-craft

## Running the scraper

run this inside your browser with the console, make sure to not be too spammy with time as you'll get rate limited

## Data

### Items.js

This file includes all items with their unicode, the most efficient recipe (so far), and their depth (sub-items you have to make)

### CurrentRecipes.json

This file includes all possible recipes I've found so far, including backwards

### UniqueRecipes.json

This file includes the first recipe found for each item, and removes all recipes that give the same item

## Contributing

use the exact same format as the files from the scraper, I'm too lazy to manually sift through them
